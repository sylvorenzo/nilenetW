            <h2>1.SLACK</h2>
            <p>
            Slack is a 21st-century team communication tool. 
            This means that the days of group messages exploding and generating 
            200 alerts at once are over, as are the days of missing messages addressed 
            at you and several groups mingling on the same setup. 
            However, communication provides much more than simply this basic capacity.
            </p>

            and manage ad campaigns, and much more for a cheap price. 
            Keeping all of your company needs centralized around your 
            branded domain and within the 
            Google platform will provide you peace of mind in knowing that everything is taken care of.

            <h2>6.Quora</h2>
            <p>
            Quora is a crowdsourced question and answer site. 
            While it may seem somewhat like Yahoo Answers, Quora requires all users to 
            have verified identities and encourages responders to fill out as much 
            information about their backgrounds as possible on their accounts. 
            This implies that anytime you or your company has a query about something 
            outside of your field of expertise, 
            you'll almost certainly be able to locate an expert to answer your question on Quora.

            parts of owning a business, especially one that is dependent on the internet. 
            Failure to educate and comprehend customers leads to bad user interface decisions, 
            a lack of knowledge of problems and wants, and a negative user experience.
