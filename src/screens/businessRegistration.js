            <h1>How To Register Your Business</h1>
            <h2>Step 1: Create an Account</h2>
            <p>
            Navigate to the CIPC's eservices website. 
            Go to the Customer Registration link on the homepage and click it.
            </p>
            <p>
            On the following page, you will be asked to enter your ID 
            number before being asked to fill out the essential personal and contact information. 
            Fill in all the essential fields. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Deposit monies into your CIPC account before you may transact on the internet. 
            The cost of reserving a business name is R50, while the cost of incorporating 
            a company with a basic Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) is R125. 
            Make sure you have enough money in your CIPC account to finish the transaction. 
            </p>
            <h2>
            Step 2: Name Your Business
            </h2>
            <p>
            First and foremost, your company should have a name. Choosing a simple, 
            memorable name will help with marketing and branding initiatives. 
            It is also important to keep in mind a name that is relevant to what is 
            being given or provided - just naming your I.T. Customers may 
            be perplexed as to what services your firm delivers if you call it "Sparkle & Shine." 
            </p>
            <p>
            Once you have settled on a name for your company, go to the CIPC eservices website 
            and select Transact, then Name Reservations from the dashboard menu that displays.
            If your first option is not available, you will be prompted to choose three other
            names. 
            </p>
            <p>
            When you submit the form, you will be given a tracking 
            number for the name reservation as well as an email confirmation of 
            the name reservation; 
            this document is known as a COR9.4. 
            </p>
            <p>Save this email and attachment.</p>
            <p>
            NB – You can register your business using the name of the registration number. 
            This may be changed later by reserving the name and then requesting a name change; 
            however, the business's MOI will need to be updated when the name change is approved. 
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3: Do Your Research – What Type of Entity Do You Want Registered?</h2>
            <p>
            Have you given much thought to the sort of business entity or corporation you want 
            to create before rushing 
            in blindly to register your firm? This is where expert 
            advisers and legal practitioners can help you choose the 
            best company for your needs. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Private (Pty) and Public (Ltd) businesses, as well as 
            Personal Liability Companies (Inc.) and Non-Profit Organizations, 
            can be incorporated in South Africa (NPO). 
            In South Africa, close corporations are no longer legal entities. 
            </p>
            <p>
            You will be offered the choice of using a Standard Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) 
            or a Bespoke MOI when creating a business via the CIPC internet portal. 
            The MOI outlines the company's "rules," including how decisions are made and 
            how the company is structured. For the sake of this essay, 
            we will solely discuss how to register a business using the normal MOI. 
            </p>
            <h2>Step 4: Registering Your Company Online</h2>
            <p>
            Make your way to Company Registration from the "Transact" page.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here, we will register your business as a legitimate legal organization. 
            Begin by entering your social security number and then clicking to proceed 
            to the next page, where you will be required to enter your personal information 
            (or that of the director if you are registering as a representative or proxy), 
            as well as the contact information of the incorporators and directors. 
            You will next be needed to fill out business information, such as the company's 
            financial year-end, number of shares issued, and so on. 
            Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding what these 
            things involve.
            </p>
            <p>We will go on to the name reservation screen after this is all done.</p>
            <p>
            We will go to the tab "Use Name Already Reserved." 
            Now look for the name reservation confirmation email (COR9.4) 
            and take note of the tracking number. 
            Continue after entering the tracking number as requested. 
            </p>
            <p>
            You will receive a new tracking number after completing the registration process. 
            After that, you will receive an email confirmation with the COR 15.1A document attached. 
            The incorporator or director must sign and date this paper. 
            </p>
            <h2>Step 5: The Final Step</h2>
            <p>
            Collect all your supporting papers now. 
            The procedure is not complete until the CIPC receives 
            the signed supporting documentation.
            </p>
            <p>You will need the following papers to finish the registration:</p>
            <li>
            Your name reservation confirmation letter.
            </li>
            <li>
            A completed COR 15.1A form.
            </li>
            <li>
             A certified copy of your South African identification card and/or.
            </li>
            <li>
            A completed Power of Attorney form (if you are acting as a representative).
            </li>
            <p>
            Scanned your papers to your computer and email them to eServicesCoReg@cipc.co.za 
            with the tracking number from the COR15.1A in the subject line. 
            After you have successfully established your business, 
            you will receive your company registration papers, 
            also known as the COR 14.3 document and the MOI. The turnaround time 
            ranges from one to three days.
            </p>
            <p>
            Your company has been established as a legal entity. 
            You may now open a business bank account 
            and register with SARS for tax reasons, among other things. 
            </p>
